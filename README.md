# 2phase-models
Comparison of simple two-phase flow simulators.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains MATLAB scripts and functions for simulating
two-phase flow. The "model" folder holds core simulation files, "Datasets"
includes example data, and "solvers" contains numerical routines.

## How to Run the Code
1. Set up the MATLAB path to include all subfolders.
2. Run "main_TestBench_kick.m" to see a sample simulation.
3. Adjust parameters in "parameters.m".
